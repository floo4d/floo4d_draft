This is the beta version of the NPV2 program. A joined development by NMRTEC and CNRS.

### What is NPK-V2 ? ###

* NPK-V2 is a program that allows the processing, the display and the analysis of data-sets
 obtained from various Fourier-Transform spectroscopies.
* For the moment, il handles the following data-sets
    * NMR - 1D and 2D are fully supported
    * FT-ICR - 1D and 2D are fully supported
    * Orbitrap - 1D only
    * _other spectroscopies are being considered_
    * Files can be imported from
        * NMR : Bruker topspin
        * FT-ICR : Bruker Apex
        * Orbitrap : Thermofisher raw data
* It allows to process datasets interactively from an ipython prompt
or interactively using the processing.py batch program (aimed towad FT-ICR for the moment)
* The batch mode supports multiprocessing, both with MPI and natively on multi-core machines (still in-progress)
* data-sets are handled in the HDF5 standard file-format, which allows virtually unlimited file size.
* Version : this is 0.5 beta version


### How do I get set up? ###
The program is in python 2.7.

A good documentation is lacking !!
look at the exmples files (eg_*.py) and at configuration files (*.mscf)
they contains valuable examples et some documentation.

NPKV2 requires the following libraries :
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* Qt / PySide
* Pytables
* mpi4py
* ...

It has been successfully tested in the **Enthought** and **anaconda** distribution.

### Organisation of the Code ###

The main program is NPKData.py, which defines NPKData object on which everything is built

Spectroscopies are defined in the FTICR.py and Orbitrap.py code, which sub class NPKData
It is prototyped as an NMR data-set, but this will change

Many programs contain routines tests (in an object unittest) that also serve as an example of use.


#### Main programs :
a small description of the files:
- NPKData.py
   the main library, allows all processing for NMR experiments (1D, 2D and 3D)
   to be used as a library, in a stand-alone program or in ipython interactive session
- FTICR.py
   an extension of NPKData for processing FT-ICR datasets (1D and 2D)
- Orbitrap.py
   an extension of NPKData for processing Orbitrap datasets (1D)

- processing.py
   a stand alone program, written on the top of FTICR.py, allowing the efficient processing
   of FT-ICR 2D datasets, with no limit on the size of the final file
   Produces multi-resolution files
   syntax :  python processing.py param_file.mscf 
- visu2D.py
   an interactive tool for visualizing 2D FT-ICR multi-resolution files
   python visu2D.py param_file.mscf

#### Directories
- Algo
   contains algorithms to process data-sets
   (MaxEnt, Fista, Laplace, etc...) not everything active !
- Display
   a small utility to choose either for regular matplotlib display of fake no-effect display (for tests)
- File
   Importers for various file format for spectrometry, as well as the HDF5 NPK native format.
- Miscellaneous
   "en vrac"
- Visu
   utilities for the Visu2D program
- util
   set of low-level tools used all over in the code
- v1
   a library implementing a compatibility with the NPKV_V1 program
- NPKv2_usage_eg
   example python programs using the various library available

- example of configuration files
    - process_eg.mscf
    - test.mscf
    - Applic_Fista_eg.mscf
    - Applic_urqrd_eg.mscf

- and various utilities

    - Applic_Fista.py		test code for Fista/Recital
    - Applic_urqrd.py		test code for urQRd
    - NPKConfigParser.py	reads .mscf files
    - NPKError.py			generates error msg
    - QC.py				Quality Check
    - Tests.py				runs all tests
    - dev_setup.py			rolls a new version
    - version.py			defines version number
    - __init__.py			defines library
    - autom_Tests.py
    - rcpylint
